1) You NEED to have a virtual environment to run this.
2) Paste WebScraper.py into a Notepad++ document and save it into the folder that has your virtual environment under the name "WebScraper.py". ANYWHERE ELSE AND IT WON'T WORK.
3) Open your virtual envirenment that houses Webscraper.py, open your virtual environment, and type/paste "pip install BeautifulSoup4" into the command line.
4) Wait for it to download.
5) Type "python WebScraper.py" into the command line and follow the commands within the program.
6) Enjoy!


I pulled code from https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-scrape-websites-with-python-and-beautifulsoup-5946935d93fe, and Walker's 
Datetime snippets into my final product.
